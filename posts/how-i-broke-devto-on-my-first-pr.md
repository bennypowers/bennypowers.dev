Today I made my first PR to dev.to, which lets you [add options to glitch embeds](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/680). I struggled to install the requirements and build the app, wrote unit tests for the new features, learned my first bits of ruby, and after a few hours of playtime, submitted the PR. It was quickly accepted, ‚ú®THANKS, @ben!üåü

That's when I noticed that every single glitch embed on the entire site was broken

Thanks to @rhymes, for pointing the problem out:

The solution was as face-palmy as the bug itself: I left out the `#` which designates an interpolation in ruby strings:

```diff
-    src={@uri}
+    src=#{@uri}
```

A fun learning exercise for me. I sincerely hope that my oversight didn't cause any inconvenience.

New PR is in flight, once the fix is live I'll write a regression test.
