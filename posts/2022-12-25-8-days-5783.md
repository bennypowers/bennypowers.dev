Back for another year, it's 8 days of Web Components tips!

## Candle 1: Hiding Unwanted Content

On the 1st night, let's start at the end. When the Maccabees liberated the Holy 
Temple in Jerusalem from Seleucid Greek invaders, they refused to light the 
Menorah with the impure oil they found left over.

To prevent your element from displaying unwanted content, use the `::slotted` 
pseudo element and the `:not` pseudo class in your [CSS][CSS].

```css
::slotted(shemen-zayit:not([type="zach"])) {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## Candle 2: CSS Shadow Parts

[CSS][CSS] shadow parts let users of your element style parts of it from the 
outside, but did you know that just like the `class` attribute, `part` can have 
multiple part names, & like the class selector (`.`), the `::part()` pseudo 
element can take a space-separated list?

That means you can create multiple overlapping sets of parts, to let your users 
choose how _mehudar_ (beautiful) their elements should be.

```ts
render() {
  return html`
    <ul>${Array.from({ length: 8 }, (_, i) => html`
      <li part="candle ${this.night < i ? '' : 'un'}lit"></li>`)}
      <li part="candle shamash lit"></li>
    </ul>
  `;
}
```

```css
web-menorah::part(candle lit)::after {
  content: 'üïØÔ∏è';
}

web-menorah::part(candle unlit)::after {
  content: 'üï≥Ô∏è';
}

web-menorah::part(candle shamash)::after {
  translate: 0 8px;
}
```

## Candle 3: Form-Associated Custom Elements

Form-Associated Custom Elements can participate in the lifecycle of [HTML][HTML] form 
elements. Set the static `formAssociated` boolean flag on the element class and 
call `attachInternals()` to hook into the browser's [accessibility][a11y] tree. 
Create custom form controls that work like native ones!

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Create Your Own Custom Controls</legend>

    <label for="menorah">Which Night?</label>
    <web-menorah id="menorah" name="night" night="3"></web-menorah>

    <label for="location">Light Outside?</label>
    <custom-switch id="location" checked></custom-switch>
  </fieldset>

  <custom-button>Light!</custom-button>
</form>
```

## Candle 4: Private State

Want to style your elements based on their state, but don't want to create new 
public APIs or new HTML attributes? Use Lit's `classMap` directive to set a 
class on a shadow container based on the private state.

Not using Lit? No problem, `classMap` is a performance optimization but you 
could do the same thing imperatively via the DOM or using your component 
library's APIs.

```js
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';
import { classMap } from 'lit/directives/class-map.js';

import { ApolloQueryController } from '@apollo-elements/core';

import { MyQuery } from './my.query.graphql';

export class StatefulElement extends LitElement {
  #query = new ApolloQueryController(this, MyQuery);
  render() {
    const { loading, error } = this.#query;
    return html`
      <div id="container"
           class="${classMap({ loading, error })}">
        <p>${this.#query.data}</p>
      </div>`;
  }
}
```

```css
#container {
  display: contents;
}

.loading {
  opacity: 0.5;
  background: grey;
}

.error {
  color: red;
}
```

## Candle 5: Noscript

Not every end-user of your web component can or wants to enable 
[javascript][JS]. Make sure to add `<noscript>` examples to your documentation. 
Even if your custom element does fancy footwork like syntax-highlighting non-js 
script tags by reading `textContent`, you can still gracefully degrade for 
noscript users.

```html
<code-block>
  <script type="text/snippet-js">
    console.log("With JS on, this gets highlighted but not run");
  </script>
</code-block>

<style>
  code-block:not(:defined),
  code-block:not(:defined) > script {
    display: block;
  }
</style>

<noscript>
  <style>
    code-block, code-block > script {
      display: block;
    }
  </style>
</noscript>
```

## Candle 6: Bare Module Specifiers

The Maccabees fought for the freedom to control their own destiny.

If your web component imports dependencies (like a base class or utilities) from 
an NPM module, use "bare" module specifiers in your sources. This gives your 
users maximum flexibility, letting them bundle, serve via module-transforming 
CDN (like JSPM or UNPKG) or use import maps to resolve the import specifiers to 
URLs.

```js
// ‚úÖ DO
import { LitElement } from 'lit';

// ‚ùå DON'T
import { LitElement } from '../../node_modules/lit/index.js';
```

## Candle 7: Interop, Part 1

The Seleucid king Antiochus tried to impose a uniform Hellenistic culture on the 
Jews, but your organization doesn't need to suffer a front-end monoculture. Web 
components work everywhere [HTML][HTML] does, so use them in your CMS' 
templates, in templates, in templates, in templates, in templates, in in in in 
your in your your your your your your your Angular forms, in your [Vue][vue] or 
Preact apps, or on performant and accessible web pages.

Write once, use everywhere.

## Candle 8: Interop, Part 2

The last night of Hannukah is called "This is Hannukah", since it encapsulates 
the entirety of the holiday.

The big idea of web components is interoperability, meaning you can use 
components with each other, mixing & matching, no matter how they were written. 
The common interface of [HTML][HTML], [CSS][CSS], & DOM events/props ties them 
together.

Use [lit][lit] components with stencil, or hybrids with FAST, and vice versa.

[CSS]: /tags/css
[JS]: /tags/javascript
