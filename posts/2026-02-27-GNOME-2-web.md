A couple of days ago, this youtube video rolled into my recommendations feed

https://youtu.be/tkUgOT22F5s

It's an essay by this youtuber called [onion boots](https://onio.club/) on how websites used to be weird and playful. And I got to thinking about how I missed that old timey tinkerer's network. Then I thought at my website, and how it looks like... a website, and decided it wasn't weird enough.

Well, its a few days later and I've turned my website into the GNOME 2 desktop circa 2002. It's built out of web components, using Lit. Specifically I used lit-ssr to generate <abbr title="declarative shadow dom">DSD</abbr> templates, and the newly baseline [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) API to make "focusing" (navigating) between "windows" (pages) feel more fluid and natural.

I'm going for a classic feel here, so I designed the webmentions (which used to appear in a sidebar or under the post) UI to look like a [Pidgin IM](https://pidgin.im/) session, and the slide decks page looks (kinda) like [OOO Impress](https://www.openoffice.org/product/impress.html).

It's got two themes. Clearlooks is based on the original CSS, and Clearlooks dark is "inspired" thereby. Maybe I'll add more themes down the line if I'm feeling up to it. I also shipped the default GNOME desktop wallpapers, so pick whichever one you like best.

It's even got Minesweeper, and calculator!

So yeah this is pretty silly but I'm also committed to the bit 🤣. Which app should I implement next? Send me a webmention to this page.
