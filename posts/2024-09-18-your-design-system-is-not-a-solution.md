You've got a problem. Your painting fell, and you want to hang it back up.
You grab a hammer and some nails, you get to swinging, you make a few
adjustments, and *Hey Presto!* before you know it, your problem is solved.

You have implemented a solution: you hung the painting.

## Tools and Solutions

Now, that solution needed a bunch of tools to get 'er done:

- the hammer
- the nails
- maybe a level or a tape measure
- your skill at swinging the hammer
- barring that, a bag of frozen peas
- the impeccable taste of your living companions

Some of those tools were essential to the solution, others less so. But they
all have one thing in common:

*none of those tools is the solution to your problem*.

If you really needed to, you could probably hang that painting with an old shoe

Consider, too, that your home is built from timber and drywall - does your
solution work for your neighbour, who built with cinderblocks and plaster?
Probably not.

## Why Design Systems

If you've been following along, you're probably waiting for the punch line,
so here it is:

> Your design system is not a solution, it's a *toolkit*

So why do companies adopt design systems? Are they just spinning their wheels?
Well, my desire to continue receiving a steady paycheque requires me to say "no, 
they aren't, design systems really do solve problems for companies!" But there's
an important difference between the kind of problem which design systems solve
and *your team*'s design problem.

Companies adopt design systems because they want:

- a "single source of truth"
- consistent visual design across large teams
- consistent standards of accessibility
- ux/ui recommendations by specialists

All of these are fancy ways of saying they want to establish and enforce
rules and guidelines for producing user interfaces. Design systems help solve 
that problem by centralizing the know how for building the components of those 
interfaces in a way which can be easily ported to different teams'
workflows.

## Solving the Wrong Problem

Design systems can't and shouldn't try to solve every team's problems. This
industry is by it's nature prone to widely varied opinions and approaches, often 
incompatible one with the other, and establishing a baseline is hard enough 
without shipping bespoke implementations for each team that comes along.

> If you don't own the problem, you can't own the solution

The specialist skills needed to produce a design system are not the same as 
those needed to ship products. Product teams often need to move quickly to ship
new features, built on top of the previous framework, and they often don't have
the luxury of The Big Rewrite™️.
