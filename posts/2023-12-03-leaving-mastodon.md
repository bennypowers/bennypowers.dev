I'm leaving Mastodon. Maybe I'll be back down the line, who knows.

I can here because it seemed like a place for like-minded professionals to discuss and develop together,
but once again it's been made clear to me that the price of admission into enlightened society is to renounce one's Judaism, and that's not something I'm willing to do.

<blockquote>But what about Mastodon's great moderation tools, can't you just block the haters?</blockquote>

Nope. The haters are on the Left and the Right, they're the elite and the hoipaloi, and they're on every instance of this social network. It's also not worth my time and anguish.

This isn't the first time I've been run out of professional development circles over my refusal to deny my Jewish, Israeli, **proudly Zionist** identity. I hope it will be the last.
