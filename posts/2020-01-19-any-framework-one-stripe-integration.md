# It's Release Day!! ðŸŽ‰

Take a <abbr title="peek">ðŸ‘€</abbr> at
[`@power-elements/stripe-elements`][npm-package], a package which exposes the
[Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js) API through cross-framework,
declarative custom elements.

What that means is that with the help of `<stripe-elements>`, you can easily
integrate Stripe credit card payments into your site, no matter which framework
you're using - if any! Even if your payment form is inside Shadow DOM (not yet
officially supported by Stripe.js), you can still take payments securely with
these custom elements.

And this [latest version][changelog] adds a nice new feature. Introducing:
`<stripe-payment-request>`

## Demo

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/stripe-web-component-vanilla-ztuvg"
        style="width:100%;height:calc(300px + 8vw); border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
        allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
        loading="lazy"
        sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>

The above demo will try to use `<stripe-payment-request>` for a nicer UX, but
if the browser is unable, will fall back to a classic `<stripe-elements>`
credit card form.

If you want to check out the Payment Request support, you'll need
- A browser which supports the [Payment Request API][payment-request] (or Apple
  Pay for Safari)
- At least one credit card saved in the browser (i.e. test card
  `4242424242424242`)
- You need a Stripe testing publishable key

To use the fallback form, all you need is the publishable key.

And like I mentioned above, [stripe-elements web components work with any
framework][framework-demos].
