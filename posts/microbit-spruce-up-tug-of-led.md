Makecode's [Tug-of-LED][orig] exercise guides your students to create a game of 
tug-of-war on their micro:bits. The exercise-as-written teaches your students 
about rounding numbers and conditional logic. We can add some polish to the 
gameplay experience while at the same time teaching concepts like **arrays**, 
and **audio frequency**. After completing the original tutorial, the students 
will be able to play a two-player game on a single micro:bit, one player per 
button. When they finish our improvements, they'll play wirelessly and with 
sound and improved graphics.

## Mapping Game State to Sound

In Tug-of-LED, a single LED lights up on the micro:bit's 5x5 display, indicating 
the position of the "knot" or the "flag" in a game of tug-of-war.
Our first goal is to play an audio tone through the micro:bit v2's speakers 
depending on the state of the game score. If the score is lower (meaning, team A 
is winning), we want to play a lower tone. If the score is higher, (meaning, 
team B is winning), we want to play a higher tone.

Let's start by creating a new variable called `rounded` which will store the 
rounded `rope` value. After that, create a new array by dragging in the `set 
list to array of "0", "1"` block. Add three positions to the array to make five 
in total. These five positions represent the five possible game states while in 
play:

```js
[
  0, // The knot is one spot away from team A's finish line
  1, // The knot is two spots away from team A's finish line
  2, // The knot is in the middle of the field
  3, // The knot is two spots away from team B's finish line
  4, // The knot is one spot away from team B's finish line
]
```

We'll use this array to store the musical tones we'd like to play whenever the 
score changes. Since the score is represented as a number from 0 to 4, we can 
represent the choice of sound to play as an array of 5 items.

From the `Music` category, drag the `Middle C` onto the first slot of the array. 
Duplicate it, and drag the copy onto the second slot, and so-on until the array 
is full of musical notes, then change the notes to range from `Middle C` to 
`Middle G`:

![On start, set rope to 2, set rounded to 2, set list to array of Middle C Middle D Middle E Middle F Middle G][list]

### Functions as Procedures

The next thing we're going to do it wrap up our drawing code in a *function*, 
called `draw`. The `draw` function will be what's called a `procedure`, meaning 
a list of code statements, to be executed one by one, whenever the `draw` 
procedure is "called" or "executed". From the `Functions` category, choose `Make a function`,
do not click on `Add a parameter` (if you do, click the X, then start again from 
`Make a function`), and change the name from `doSomething` to `draw`.

Move the contents of the `forever` loop into the `draw` function's body, then 
drag `call draw` from the functions category into the `forever` loop, to restore 
the functionality.

![function draw() clear screen, if rope < 0 then show string "A"; else if rope > 4 then show string "B"; else plot x rounded y 2][draw]

Notice that we slightly modified the original tutorial's version of this code - 
ours uses the `rounded` variable, and only plots the LED if one team or the 
other has not yet won.

While we're here, **make sure** to add `call draw` at the bottom of our `on 
start` block, so that something appears on screen at the start of the game.

### Updating the Game

The original example used a `while` loop to constantly update the game state. 
Using our newfound understanding of functions we can score a minor 
*optimization* by only running that code when the user presses a button. Create 
a new function called `updateScoreBy`, and give it a single number as a 
parameter. In that block, set a new variable called `last` to the value of 
rounded, then `change rope by num` (by the parameter passed in), then `set 
rounded to round(rope)`. After all that, call `draw` to update the screen.

![function updateScoreBy(num) set last to rounded; change rope by num; set rounded to round(rope)][update]

The reason we're bothering to save the last value of `rounded` before updating 
it and drawing the screen is for the next step, playing the audio. Change the 
contents of our `on button pressed` blocks to call our `updateScoreBy` function 
instead:

![on button A pressed call updateScoreBy(-0.1) on button A pressed call 
updateScoreBy(0.1)][onbutton]

Now that we've accomplished that, let's delete our `forever` loop, since we now 
only update the screen when a button is pressed.

### Audio Processing

Our last step for this tutorial will be to play the correct musical tone 
whenever the score changes, but we have a problem. The micro:bit v2 is capable 
of playing sounds "in the background", i.e. starting playback but then 
immediately moving on to the next statement even before playback finishes. 
However, it is only able to do this with special `SoundEffect` objects, not with 
the musical notes we added to our array earlier. Those notes are actually just 
numbers; for example, "Middle C" is actually the number `262`, representing an 
audio pulse with a frequency of 262Hz.

Explain to your students how frequency gives rise to tone, perhaps with the 
example of a bumblebee's wings, which beat at a frequency between 105 and 205Hz. 
We'll use the frequency number in our array to create a `SoundEffect`.

Drag in an `if` block and a `â‰ ` comparison, and set the predicate of the `if` 
block to `if last != rounded`. This way, we'll only play the tone when the score 
changes by whole numbers. Then, drag the `Play sound until done` block down onto 
the workspace, and change the timing from `until done` to `in background`.

Create a new variable called `tone` or `frequency` and set it in the `if` block 
to the list value at `rounded`. In this way, we'll play the frequency which 
corresponds to the current score.

Press the `+` to expand the sound effect block, and set the start *and* end 
frequency tones to `tone`. Set the duration to 2000 milliseconds. You can adjust 
this duration to suit your taste afterwards. Now, drag that whole `if` block 
into our `updateScoreBy` function, just before the `call draw` block, so that 
the sound plays whenever the score updates.

![if last != rounded then set tone to list get value at rounded, play sound 
start frequency tone end frequency tone duration 2000 in background][sound]

## Demo
Take a look at the completed project here:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:81.97%;overflow:hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---run?id=_bUgM2i0qCVTj"
          style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"
          allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms
          allow-scripts allow-same-origin" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

In our next lesson, we'll work on making the game wireless and using gestures 
instead of buttons.
