**NeoVim**: a learning experience.
Used to atom's `vim-mode-plus`
But the userland is *different* from HTML/CSS/JSS

**LUA!**:
No parentheses ever!
Extremely limited syntax!
Super-Imperative!

**Treesitter!**:
Wow, People still LISP, Cool!
lots' of "salami" debugging for queries.
`TSPlayground`
Online Playground.
Occasional Parser bugs (negative lookbehind).
Missing APIs (user queries).
