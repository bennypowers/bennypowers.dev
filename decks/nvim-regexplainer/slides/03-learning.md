<section slot="notes">

Moving to NeoVim was a learning experience
I was used to the keybindings from atom's `vim-mode-plus`
But the userland API is *very different* from HTML/CSS/JSS

LUA!
- No parentheses ever!
- Extremely limited syntax!
- Super-Imperative!

Treesitter!
- Wow, People still LISP, Cool!
- lots' of "salami" debugging for queries
- TSPlayground
- Online Playground
- Occasional Parser bugs (negative lookbehind)
- Missing APIs (user queries)
