## PatternFly React
Adopting React was a sensible choice at the time, since most - *but not all* - 
PatternFly users were already using it, or were able to use it.

One unfortunate side effect of the decision to go all-in on react is that it cut 
some use cases off from the latest-and-greatest designs. PatternFly v4 core 
provided some css classes, but teams using it had to implement their own 
interactions. PatternFly React was great if you were already using react, but 
harder to interop with if you weren't.

# PART 3: Tech Demo

write a simple demo,

```bash
mkdir /tmp/pfe-demo
cd /tmp/pfe-demo
touch index.html
python -m http.server
```

# CONCLUSION
## The Future
  - demo react wrapper
  - more components (get involved on github!)

## Thanks
