## Semantic Assertions - PROS

- Puts usability first
- The curb cut effect

<img alt="curb cuts"
     src="images/curb.jpeg"
     style="position: absolute;
            inset: 0;
            object-fit: fill;
            margin-inline: auto;">

the curb cut here is that we can test for correctness **based on effects**, rather than
by asserting on the **private DOM** structure
