## What is HTML? {slot=heading}

The **root** element of every HTML document is the `<html>` element. It has two 
children: `<head>` and `<body>`.

`<head>` contains document metadata and links to subresources, `<body>` is where 
the document content goes.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Basic HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <p>Body content lives in landmarks</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
