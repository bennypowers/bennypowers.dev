## HTML Forms {slot=heading}

Starting with HTML 2 in 1995, HTML gained the ability to receive **user input** 
via `<form>`, and not just display author's content. Prior to `<form>`, the only 
way to publish content on the web was to write an HTML document and publish it 
to a web server via FTP, for example.

The widespread adoption of `<form>` led to a user-content revolution which came 
to be known as "Web 2.0". Wikipedia, Twitter, MySpace ⇨ Facebook, Flickr ⇨ 
Instagram all owe their existence to HTML forms.
