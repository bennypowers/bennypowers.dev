## Semantic HTML {slot="heading"}

### Some Interesting Elements

HTML already comes with a number of interesting built-in elements:

<div style="position: relative;">

- `<time>` to mark a point in time
- `<mark>` to highlight a portion of text
- `<code>` to represent source code
- `<article>` for an independent, distributable content, e.g: blog post, 
  comment, interactive widget, etc

<div style="position:absolute;inset:0;background:white;" reveal>

- `<address>` contact information for the page or `<article>`
- `<bdi>` for <bdi>טקסט דו-כיווני</bdi>: content in any direction!
- `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`, the Definition list, term, and definition elements 
  (since in HTML 1.0!)

And many more, listed in the [living standard][elements]
