## Semantic HTML {slot="heading"}

### Interactive Content

Interactive content is how your users interact with the page, the web server, or 
another server entirely.

- hyperlinks: `<a href>`
- multimedia: `<audio controls>` and `<video controls>`
- forms: `<button>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<label>`

{% rhalert state="warning" %}
Ensure all your interactive content is accessible by keyboard, not just by 
pointers like tap or mouse.
{% endrhalert %}
