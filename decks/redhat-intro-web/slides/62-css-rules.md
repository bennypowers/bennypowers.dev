## What is CSS? {slot=heading}

### Syntax

Stylesheets are made up of **rules**. Each rule has a **selector list** of one 
or more selectors, followed by a set of curly braces `{ }`. Inside the braces is 
a list of **declarations**, separated by semicolons `;`. Each declaration has a 
**property** on the left side, and one or more **values** on the right side, 
separated by a colon.

```css
h1, h2 {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: purple;
}
```
