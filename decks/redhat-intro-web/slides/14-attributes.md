## What is HTML? {slot=heading}

### Attributes

HTML **attributes** live in the **open tag**, after the tag name. They are 
key-value pairs separated by `=`, where the value is surrounded by quotation 
marks.

```html
<a href="https://redhat.com">Red Hat</a>
```

Some attributes, like `id`, are global. Others, like `href`, are specific to 
certain elements.
