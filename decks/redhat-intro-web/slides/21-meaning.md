## Semantic HTML {slot="heading"}

### Meaning in Structure

HTML elements have *meanings*. The meaning which HTML elements convey to their 
context and contents is called **HTML semantics** It's important to use the 
correct semantics so that people and machines can correctly interpret the intent 
of your documents.

Incorrect semantics can lead to **broken experiences** for many users, and 
ultimately lost revenue for the owners of the page.
