### Progressive Enhancement

Before writing any JavaScript, it's critical to ensure that your HTML and CSS 
are correct, comprehensive, and sufficient. **Progressive enhancement** is the 
practice of using JavaScript to add additional features and niceties to an 
*already complete* application experience.

Sometimes JavaScript fails to load. Some users disable javascript in their 
browsers. Many users use low-power devices, and the cost of parsing and 
executing large JS bundles is non-trivial.
