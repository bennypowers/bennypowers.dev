## What is CSS? {slot=heading}

### Flexbox

CSS boxes also have an "inner display type" which governs how their contents are 
laid out. The `display: flex;` declaration turns a box into a **flex box**, 
which means the contents will flex to fill the available space, according to the 
rules you define.
