## What are Web Components
(large scale - compare to native ui frameworks) {slot=notes}

UI toolkits and frameworks stretching back to Delphi 1 (1995) have modelled UIs 
around **components** - reusable, encapsulated objects with consistent external 
APIs

## The Web Lacked a Component Model
Until 2015, when a group of browser and web developers at Google produced the 
first iteration of **Polymer**: an initial concept for what would eventually 
become the Web Components standards.

## Advantages of Web Components
- Performance / Low Overhead
- Interoperability
- Future Proof
- Knowledge Transfer

## What can you Build with Web Components?
  - full apps/ SPAs
  - design systems

## PatternFly Design, but Web Components
- based on design from PF upstream
- but using HTML-first, browser native component model
- look at some components
    - card (mostly css)
    - accordion
    - jump links (mostly javascript)

## The Future
  - demo react wrapper
  - more components (get involved on github!)
