In June of 2016, was brought on board to manage WordPress projects, and soon
became the lead developer for special projects and apps. Designed and coded
several apps using [polymerfire](http://github.com/firebase/polymerfire). My
experience with <abbr title="accessibility">a11y</abbr>; and <abbr title="User
Experience">UX</abbr> and graphic design contributed to the success of a number
of projects.

Led a number of initiatives at the company to improve the company's agility and
scalability, including <abbr title="continuous integration / continuous
deployment">CI/CD</abbr> pipelines, Slack, GitLab, and a trello-based sales
funnel.
