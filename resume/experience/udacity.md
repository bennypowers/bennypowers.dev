As a student mentor, engaged with the students assigned to me through private
messages, encouraging them, answering their questions, sharing resources, and
generally being there for them. Helped the general student population online
via Slack, for example by leading technical <abbr title="ask me
anything">AMA</abbr>s. Integrated third party services in a declarative,
product-oriented <abbr title="application programmer interface">API</abbr>.

Reviewed student submissions, providing feedback and approving their projects
according a rubric.
