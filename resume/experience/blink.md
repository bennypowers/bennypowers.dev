Built a Progressive Web App frontend and GraphQL server that exposed objects
from our own document store as well as third party services in a declarative,
product-oriented <abbr title="application programmer interface">API</abbr>.
Technologies and techniques included lit-html, Apollo GraphQL, functional
programming, Rollup, CSS Grid, Web Share API, workbox, code splitting,
tree-shaking, precaching, and lazy-loading to improve loading performance.

Implemented <abbr title="test-driven development">TDD</abbr> and <abbr
title="continuous integration / continuous deployment">CI/CD</abbr> with unit
and integration testing on front- and backend

Used AWS web services (lambda, API gateway, cloudfront) to continuously deploy
microservices.

Wrote an open-source component base class (~4.5k downloads) which reduced our
boilerplate by dozens of lines of code per file.

Mentored coworkers through design and code review, tech talks, and
documentation.
