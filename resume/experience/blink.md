Built a <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> frontend and GraphQL
server combining app and third party data in a declarative, product-oriented
<abbr title="application programmer interface">API</abbr>. Techniques included
functional programming, code splitting, tree-shaking, precaching, and
lazy-loading to improve loading performance.

Implemented <abbr title="test-driven development">TDD</abbr> and <abbr
title="continuous integration / continuous deployment">CI/CD</abbr> with unit
and integration testing on front- and backend. Used AWS web services (lambda,
API gateway, cloudfront) to continuously deploy microservices.

Wrote an open-source component base class (~4.5k downloads) which reduced our
boilerplate by dozens of lines of code per file.

Mentored coworkers through design and code review, tech talks, and
documentation.
