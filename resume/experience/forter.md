Lead development of a comprehensive library of UI web components, e.g. text
fields, dropdown menus, etc. Developed and maintained new features for a
complex <abbr title="business-to-business">B2B</abbr> dashboard web app. As
part of this project, we incrementally updated our legacy front- and back-end
stack using web components, while avoiding "The Big Rewrite".

Mentored peers & junior developers in web technologies like WAI-ARIA, ES2019,
Custom Elements, DOM, functional JS.
  
Helped develop the company's Open Source offerings, and contributed to
developer tools both in CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and in the front-end stack using
webpack, rollup, yarn, etc.
